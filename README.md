# komdas-repository

a compilation of past college works for the basic computation subject using python. 
I would hardly call this "basic" but to say it's advanced would also be a lie

As you can see, not all of the files were uploaded because I couldn't bother uploading the rest
(or some of them I just straight up copy pasted)

it was fun and also hell, my wish is to become a fullstack dev but hey if I can't do python idk how I'm going to do anything else

anyways, enjoy the bits and pieces of broken code here and there

peace

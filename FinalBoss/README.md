# Final Boss
You're probably wondering why I called this FinalBoss, and why it deserves a whole file
<br>or maybe you don't care, that's fine too

This was my final asignment and it was one hell of an asignment<br> 
by all means, for actual data analysts or actual devs this would've probably been easy, considering the use of pandas and matplotlib<br>
but you know, we as students didn't actually learn about those libraries from the subject itself. Most of it came from either reading documentations or asking chatGPT

Now this code isn't entirely mine, I had a friend who was an experienced fullstack dev show his code for me (he's enrolling in the same university as me)<br>
I didn't steal his code. Well I guess I kinda did, and most of the work was from copilot or chatGPT anyways, so I don't have anything to really say anything about this.<br>
It was pretty hard learning the logic behind pandas and matplotlib (even though again, it was mostly my friend, chatGPT, and copilot doing the job) but hey it was interesting to see how the libraries worked.<br>
(*considering the exam covered these two libraries, thankfully it was open book, the pandas and matplotlib cheat sheet helped a little bit*)

well that's it, I don't want to drag this out more than I have to.<br>
peace<br>

*p.s I know in "Nilaifilsafat2" there's an error, but I couldn't care less considering the figures I need to show was already there*
